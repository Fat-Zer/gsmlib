INTRODUCTION

     This distribution contains a library to access GSM mobile phones
     through GSM modems or IrDA devices. Features include:

     * modification of phonebooks stored in the mobile phone or on the
       SIM card

     * reading and writing of SMS messages stored in the mobile phone

     * sending and reception of SMS messages

     Additionally, some simple command line programs are provided to
     use these functionalities.


REQUIREMENTS

     You need a mobile phone that conforms to the GSM
     standards ETSI GSM 07.07, ETSI GSM 07.05, and others.
     Non-GSM mobile phones will not work! Additionally,
     to access the mobile phone from the computer you will probably need an
     GSM modem (that would be a PC-CARD, usually). There might be some
     mobile phones, however, that incorporate directly terminal
     adapter (TA) functionality. Access via IrDA interfaces is also
     reported to work.

     If you want to compile the library yourself please also read
     doc/README.developers.


INSTALLATION

     This distribution uses autoconf/automake/libtool. See the file
     INSTALL for generic installation instructions. The default
     commands for installation under /usr/local would be:

       ./configure
       make
       make install

     If there are any problems you can generate a debug version. See
     doc/README.developers for details.

     To generate the ./configure script itself when building directly from a
     source code repository use:

       ./bootstrap.sh


AVAILABLE DOCUMENTATION

     For the command line tools UNIX manual pages are available in the
     doc subdirectory of this distribution. These are installed by
     default in the directories /usr/local/man1, man7, and man8.

     See also the files doc/README.developers, doc/README.NLS and doc/FAQ.

     Note 1: Some of the mobile phones have an integrated GSM modem
     that can be accessed via the Linux IrDA drivers.

     Note 2: Some of the abovementioned phones have still some glitches
     with gsmlib (and I haven't tested them myself).

     For the following phones I receive a lot of errors reports:

     - Ericcson SH888: SMS function don't work with many firmware releases

     This list is not exhaustive, there are probably many other types of
     phone or GSM modem that work with gsmlib. Just try it and report back
     to me!


DISCLAIMER

     Even though care has been taken in the design and implementation
     of this software it can not be excluded that this software could
     destroy data in your mobile phone or may even render your mobile
     phone useless (by erroneous PIN settings, for example). The

     PUBLIC LICENSE), ie. it is allowed to link
     the library to commercial programs.

     See the file COPYING for details on the license.


BUGS

     If something does not work with your OS platform or the mobile/TA
     combination please check first that you can connect to your phone with
     program execution that did fail. Make sure to compile with debugging
     gsmlib-based programs fail (with the same serial interface parameters,
     of course), then send a complete trace of the compilation or the
     to software@pxh.de. I promise not to publish telephone numbers or other
     me to do much about the problem. Send bug reports to the mailing list
     or to software@pxh.de. I promise not to publish telephone numbers or
     other private informatio
     
     Debugging output is controlled by the environment variable
     GSMLIB_DEBUG. A value of 0 means no debugging output. 1 means
     extensive debugging output. 2 prints every character exchanged between
     gsmlib and the TA (GSM modem/mobile phone).
     
     In case of segmentations faults etc. please send a backtrace made with
     gdb.
