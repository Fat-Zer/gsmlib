*** 1. I get the error
       /usr/local/bin/gsmsmsd [ERROR]: cannot route status report message to TE

Some phones/modems cannot route all kinds of SMS to the TE
(computer). Please try

  gsmsmsd no_stat

This is documented in the gsmsmsd manual page.


*** 2. Siemens M20T expects an initial PIN.

For the Siemens M20T an initial PIN must be send once (probably when
it is switched on or the computer is powered on). This PIN is used for
all subsequent invocations of gsmlib-based programs. The trick is to
issue the following program (eg. in the rc-scripts of the operating system):

  gsmctl -I "+cpin=<MY PIN>"


*** 3. Sending SMS with or retrieving SMS from my Ericsson SH888 does
not work.

Set the environment variable GSMLIB_SH888_FIX:

export GSMLIB_SH888_FIX=1     (bash)
setenv GSMLIB_SH888_FIX 1     (tcsh)

If it works now, I need your model number. You could just enter
"AT+CGMM" in a terminal program and send me the results. Alternatively 
set the environment variable GSMLIB_DEBUG=2 and me the dump.

*** 4. I get the error "ME/TA error 'Unidentified subscriber' (code
28)" when trying to send SMS using gsmsendsms or gsmsmsd.

The SMS service centre address (SCA, the phone number of the centre that is
accepting SMS for delivery) is not set correctly in your phone. There
are three ways to correct this:

1. set the default SCA (example is for Germany T-D1):

  gsmctl -o setsca "+491710760000"

2. Use the menus of your phone to set the SMS SCA.

3. Use the option "--sca 1234567" for the gsmsmsd, gsmsmsstore, and
gsmsendsms programs. This tries to set the SCA in the SMS itself (does
not change default SCA) and might not work with all phones.

*** 5. gsmlib works unreliably with my phone.

Try another baudrate, even higher baudrates sometimes work better then
lower ones.
