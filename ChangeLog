gsmlib-1.5
     - adapted MeTa::getCurrentOPInfo() and MeTa::getAvailableOPInfo()
       to handle Nokia 8290 quirks

     - code to set line speed in gsm_unix_serial reinserted (it was
       accidentally removed in previous version)

     - minor changes to initialization sequence in gsm_unix_serial

     - bugfix in gsm_unix_serial.cc: readByte() == 0 does not mean no
       more bytes, but is legal value

     - additionally allowed characters "*#pwPW" and '+' at any
       position in telephone numbers

     - added environment variable GSMLIB_SH888_FIX that (if set)
       enables the gsmlib workaround for Ericsson SH888's broken SMS TPDUs

     - fixed command line parameter handling bug in gsmsmsstore

     - fixed %files section .spec file to correctly include manual pages

     - fixed some bugs in terminal line setup (gsm_unix_serial) regarding
       software/hardware handshake 

     - added new "--sca" option to SMS-related apps to set the SMS
       service centre address on the command line (useful if default is not
       set correctly in the phone)

     - removed tcflush() call in UnixSerialPort::putLine that broke
       the event system needed for gsmsmsd

gsmlib-1.4
     - more attempts to fix UNIX serial port access

     - allow custom backends for sorted phonebooks to be integrated
       into gsmlib (eg. for RDBMS or LDAP storage). Introduced a new
       module gsm_sorted_phonebook_base that contains the infrastructure for
       this.

     - Now gsmlib needs at least gcc-2.95.2 to compile correctly.

     - Implemented option to open device with software handshaking (XON/XOFF).
       The applications now have an -X option to turn this on.

     - gsmlib now contains a facility to interrupt ongoing activity in a
       controlled way. gsm_unix_serial now blocks for one second
       maximum until it checks whether it was interrupted.

     - various small bugfixes

     - added workaround for phones that omit ':' in AT command responses

     - all debugging output is now printed to stderr

     - gsm_unix_serial: new attempt to initialize modem in a more
       robust way (contributed)

     - gsm_sms: fixed handling of user data header (contributed)

gsmlib-1.3
     - fixed bug that caused gsmlib to hang if TAs don't respond
       to AT inquiries for serial number etc.

     - fixed bug with handling of CB mode AT command construction in
       gsm_me_ta.cc, setSMSRoutingToTA()

     - allow '+' as the first character of phonenumbers

     - implemented reading and writing from/to stdin/stdout in
       gsm_sorted_[sms_store|phonebook] and gsmpb/gsmsmsstore

     - fixed (hopefully) the intermittent hangup problem in
       gsm_unix_serial_port

     - Some mobile phones cannot report the status of some facility
       locks. The gsmctl program now prints out "unknown" in the
       corresponding result line from the FLSTAT
       operation if this problem occurs (instead of terminating).

     - switched off non-blocking access to serial device

gsmlib-1.2
     - gsmlib now also works with TAs that can not switch off echo

     - fixed bug that prevented gsmlib from copying SMS_DELIVER and 
       SMS_STATUS_REPORT back to the ME

     - introduced -I (--init) parameter to all command line apps to
       allow for device-specific initialization

     - made SMS decoding routines more robust against bad SMS (especially
       premature end of PDU)

     - New debugging feature: If compiled without NDEBUG, the
       environment variable GSMLIB_DEBUG determines the verbosity of
       debugging messages (0 = none, 1 = many, 2 = extreme)

gsmlib-1.1

     - Parse multiple COPS (operator info) lines returned by some phones

     - accept string as numeric value when interpreting COPS=? response
       (Ericsson phone + GSM12 GSM module)

     - accept string as numeric value when interpreting COPS? response
       (Ericsson phone + GSM12 GSM module)

     - retry when initializing TA (ATZ/ATE0 sequences)

     - Set SMS routing:
       allow mode 3 (special in-band technique) when setting routing
       to TA (gsmlib should not be active when phone is switched to data mode
       anyway) 

    -  Set SMS routing:
       handle buffer mode but only if it was reported by the +CNMI=? command
       (the Ericsson GM12 GSM modem does not like it otherwise)

     - Determine CPMS number of parameters for CPMS command (better
       compability with some mobile phones / GSM modems)

     - handle missing service centre address in incoming SMS for Ericsson
       model 6050102

     - add new RING event to gsm_event.h/.cc, gsmsmsd now handles RING
       indications properly

     - defined default event handler mostly to handle unexpected RING
       indications that might otherwise confuse gsmlib

     - gsmsmsd: can now be cleanly terminated using the SIGINT or SIGTERM
       signals

     - gsmsmsd: now handles multiple incoming SMS messages cleanly, before
       there was a chance that some SMS messages coming in rapid succession
       might have been lost

     - gsmsmsd: flush option implemented that dispatches and erases
       existing messages in SMS store

     - gsmsmsd: added sending of SMS messages. gsmsmsd now accepts a
       spool directory options where it expects to find SMS message file in a 
       simple format, these are dispatched every 5 seconds

gsmlib-1.0

     - RPM support (spec file)

     - the "+" is at least for the Siemens S10 and S25 a valid char in 
       telephone numbers (inserts a pause of 3 seconds), therefore it is now
       allowed as part of telephone numbers

     - fixed incorrect analysis of facility class parameters in gsmctl.cc

     - restricted call forward time to 0..30 seconds in gsm_me_ta.cc

gsmlib-0.3

     - implemented timeout for accessing the mobile phone in order
       to avoid hangs

     - upgraded to BETA status

     - written glossary for abbreviations (gsminfo(7))

     - implemented NLS support, added German translations

     - implemented preserving the index position of phonebook entries in 
       gsmpb.cc and gsm_sorted_phonebook

     - cleaned up manual pages (alphabetic ordering of options etc.)

     - gsmsmstore program and gsm_sorted_sms_store./.cc completed and
       tested

     - gsmpb and gsmsmsstore now have --verbose (-V) options for detailed
       progress reporting

     - now check for getopt_long in configure (can be compiled on non-GNU
       systems)

     - removed asserts regarding lengths of numeric data types, put them
       into configure script

     - sorted options in apps/*.cc alphabetically (--help option)

     - in gsm_sorted_sms_store compare telephone numbers more sensibly

     - introduced -v option to gsmpb and gsmsmsstore to report execution
       statistics 

     - tested new synchronization function in gsmpb program

     - implemented operations in the gsmctl program

     - rewrote test cases (compare output)

     - completed gsmsmsstore program

     - first changes for compilation with VC++ 6.0 on WIN32

gsmlib-0.2

     - gsmsmstore program and gsm_sorted_sms_store./.cc mostly
       completed but not yet much tested

     - Fixed problem with some mobiles/TAs not giving prefixes after
       certain AT sequences (reported for SIEMENS S25/IrDA, Nokia
       8810/IrDA)

     - Fixed problem with Xircom REM56G.100/Nokia 6150 that give
       "CABLE: GSM" instead of "OK" after ATZ

     - Mobiles that return nothing when empty phonebook entries are
       requested are now handled correctly (reported for SIEMENS S25/IrDA)

     - optimizations in gsm_*_phonebook modules (less AT commands necessary)

     - new synchronization function in gsmpb program that is (hopefully)
       more sensible (see man page for details)

gsmlib-0.1

     - Initial release
